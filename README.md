# Software Engineering - Scheduler Project

## Description:
This project was designed in the Software Engineering course at SUNY Newpaltz - Fall 2020.
It is the first iteration of a tool meant to be used by Academic Departments at colleges 
for the purpose of scheduling courses without conficts on a semester by semester basis.

## Tools / Technologies:
The stack we used was HTML5-CSS-JavaScript-PHP and our database was built using MySQL.
Per our client's request no frameworks, or external libraries were used in this project.

Some members of the team opted to use Adobe Dreamweaver but ultimately a combination of
XAMPP and Visual Studio Code were the tools most useful to us.

## Client's requests / MVP:
1. User sign-in system for Schedulers and Schedule-Viewers.
2. Data management system for adding, removing and editing data.
3. ADA Compliance.
4. Schedule selected courses on a semester by semester basis.
5. Automatically resolve scheduling conflicts.
6. Allow consideration of instructor's schedule preferences (for adjunct/non-fulltime staff).
7. Allow consideration of degree-plans to ensure that students can reasonably take required
  courses to graduate on time.

## Last-Update:
Our last update to the project included style changes, and completion of data
management features.  Work began on course-scheduling but was incomplete.
